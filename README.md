# weather-dashboard

## Description
In building this application, first I focused on the barebones of the style of the page and creating my static elements. Next I did the initial fetch function for surrent weather. After establishing that function I made sure the search input would run the fetch function and then tackled the rest of my fetches. Throughout, I incorporated bootstrap and css to make the page functional in design.
